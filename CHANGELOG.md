# Changelog

## v1.3.0
- Improved Target Accuracy factor attribution while retaining exactly four factors. Recent writes, threshold/deadband holds, inverter boundaries, and stable off-target control are now attributed to **Control response**; measured load and PV changes are separated using the estimated house-load change. **Other** is reserved for genuinely unclassified samples.

### Entity renaming and migration
- Renamed all active runtime entities from `pv_ems_*` to `hpvc_*`.
- Renamed diagnostic entities to `sensor.hpvc_diag_*`.
- Renamed the Settings helper to `input_boolean.hpvc_config`.
- Added migration and upgrade guidance for renamed helpers, dashboards, automations, and external references.

### Charge Priority and multi-battery control
- Added per-battery Charge Priority using each battery's SOC, charging power, and known charge headroom.
- Added SOC hysteresis, adaptive high-SOC taper handling, and independent startup and telemetry recovery per battery.
- Excluded unavailable or nonnumeric battery telemetry individually without blocking remaining valid batteries.
- Kept stable numeric SOC and power values eligible even when unchanged; post-reveal response credit still requires a new power sample after a probe.
- Treated fresh battery-power telemetry as the authoritative freshness signal while allowing slower SOC updates.
- Retained the last valid maximum charge-power setting through temporary entity unavailability.
- Calculated and summed reveal allowance independently for every eligible battery.
- Added SOC-based reveal probes: 200 W at 90–94%, 100 W at 95–96%, 50 W at 97–98%, 25 W at 99%, and 0 W at 100%.
- Allowed eligible idle batteries to start charging with an SOC-capped first probe when the request exceeds the inverter deadband.
- Excluded batteries with unknown maximum charge power from Reveal headroom.
- Prevented unrestricted full-PV priority when available headroom is small or uncertain.
- Added independent inverter availability so one unavailable inverter does not block the others.
- Added 5 W per-inverter write suppression, post-clamp target rebalancing, and per-inverter verification diagnostics.

### Hidden PV Reveal
- Weighted Daily Reveal Accuracy by requested reveal watts, so larger probes contribute more than tiny probes.
- Based Reveal penalties on an independently estimated achievable PV increase captured before each probe; the observed response can no longer reduce its own scoring denominator.
- Excluded evaluations with stale grid/PV telemetry or unsettled inverter-limit writes from Reveal Accuracy and stability scoring.
- Made Hidden PV Reveal fully automatic and adaptive across multiple batteries.
- Improved reveal sizing from grid target, measured battery response, available headroom, and high-SOC limits.
- Added stronger response detection, pause and recovery behavior, and stability handling.
- Required two consecutive poor responses before entering a low-stability pause.
- Increased response settling time to reduce false telemetry penalties.
- Added a Reveal Insight when fresh grid telemetry does not arrive before the evaluation timeout; the skipped probe is not scored.
- Prevented additional PV from being revealed when it mainly becomes unnecessary export.
- Kept normal export limiting and Import Restore active whenever full-PV priority is not justified.
- Corrected Reveal Insights to show `Grid → Target` without reversed above/below wording.
- Tracked the actual Reveal pause reason so recovery Insights match the original cause.
- Changed Reveal Accuracy to measure movement toward Target Export.
- Counted overshoot only after grid power passes beyond Target Export and deadband.
- Recorded Reveal Accuracy only when `revealEffectiveness` is finite; inactive cycles remain unavailable instead of being counted as 0%.

### Reliability and control safety
- Separated configuration validation from temporary live-input readiness.
- Required numeric grid, price, PV, and active inverter-limit values before control can run.
- Prevented inverter writes while required live inputs are unavailable.
- Resumed control automatically after all required values recover.
- Preserved the intended priority of negative-price mode, Import Restore, export limiting, cooldown, and `sun.sun` night restore.
- Improved restart handling, validation, cooldown behavior, and safe state cleanup.
- Fixed the `rememberedMaxChargePowers is not defined` runtime error that stopped battery processing, inverter writes, and Insights.
- Flattened multi-message output batching for the HBC detection/status port so Node-RED always receives a valid one-level message array.
- Corrected Reveal Accuracy attribution to use the real `adjust` action instead of the unreachable `limit` action.
- Added report build/write error handling that resets report-state helpers and creates a persistent notification.
- Initialized report-state helpers to off after Home Assistant restart or reload, preventing stale View or Generating states.

### Diagnostics and reports
- Rebuilt the HTML and TXT support reports around one shared data model so labels, values, and ordering remain synchronized.
- Added executive status, decision-trigger evaluation, directional grid power, expanded inverter and battery diagnostics, Reveal blocking reasons, sensor health, and existing Insights.
- Added per-battery status, telemetry age, reason, raw charger headroom, and current Reveal allowance.
- Added configured inverter maximum and minimum power to both report formats.
- Displayed requested inverter target only when a write is pending; otherwise the report shows an em dash.
- Fixed inverter diagnostics so calculated targets are not reported as requested writes when no action is allowed.
- Fixed Control settings showing `unavailable` because the HTML renderer searched obsolete TXT labels.
- Fixed the Reveal diagnostics extractor for **Reveal stability score**, **Response guard**, and **PV recovery detected**.
- Fixed TXT **Response evaluation** so it matches the HTML report (`Pending` or `Inactive`).
- Fixed Daily Target Accuracy so samples are collected only when active inverter limits are physically binding; low solar availability no longer lowers accuracy.
- Added availability handling so missing accuracy samples remain unavailable while a genuine measured 0% remains numeric.
- Removed inverter entity IDs from the HTML inverter table and retained only inverter names and values.
- Made the HTML report responsive with stacked mobile cards, reflowed Sensor Health, a compact header, collapsible sections, and quick navigation.
- Kept all report diagnostics limited to existing entities, runtime state, flow context, and already-calculated HPVC values.
- Replaced background report refresh with an on-demand three-state workflow: **Generate report**, **Generating…**, and **View report**.
- Added `input_boolean.hpvc_report_ready` and `input_boolean.hpvc_report_generating`.
- Removed startup, periodic, telemetry-driven, and event-driven report generation.
- Prevented report rewrites from following the 15-second control cycle so an open report remains stable while being read.
- Added one-time no-cache revalidation when viewing a generated report so mobile browsers do not show an older cached snapshot.
- Added automatic reset to **Generate report** through a same-origin Home Assistant webhook after the report is opened.
- Kept the report workflow free of browser token handling and exposed Node-RED ports.

### Dashboard and onboarding
- Reorganized Main, Settings, diagnostics, graphs, accuracy, and Insights.
- Renamed the **Restore recommended settings** dashboard action to **Restore defaults** without changing its behavior.
- Added guided first-install onboarding while keeping HBC optional.
- Kept Main dashboard content hidden until onboarding is complete.
- Restored native top badges in the order Status, Inverters, HBC strategy, and Batteries.
- Hid HBC strategy and battery status when HBC control is off.
- Used broadly supported icons for HBC strategy and battery status.
- Restored the native Home Assistant Power Flow history graph and omitted HBC-only series when HBC control is off.
- Simplified the Debug accuracy area to two current-day native accuracy tiles.
- Used tile-card availability behavior so missing accuracy samples show unavailable while valid 0–100% values remain visible.
- Added a compact 6-column report control with amber Generate, orange Generating, and green View states.
- Ensured tapping either the View tile body or icon opens the generated report.
- Reorganized the Node-RED canvas into labeled control-trigger, control-output, dashboard/diagnostics, and on-demand report sections without changing runtime wiring.

### Documentation
- Updated installation, configuration, How it Works, and troubleshooting documentation.
- Updated entity migration and upgrade instructions.
- Updated the entity inventories for the final report helpers and workflow.
- Synchronized the README, changelog, release notes, and v1.3.0 release page.
- Removed obsolete references to periodic, automatic, event-driven, or token-based report generation.

### Upgrade notes
- Replace the Home Assistant package, dashboard, and Node-RED flow together.
- Update external references that still use `pv_ems_*`, `sensor.hpvc_debug_*`, or `input_boolean.hpvc_debug`.
- Review renamed helper values before enabling HPVC.
- Generate a new report after upgrading to verify the final three-state report workflow.

## v1.2.0

> v1.1.2 was never released. All work that was temporarily staged as v1.1.2 is included in this v1.2.0 public release. Users can upgrade directly from v1.1.1 to v1.2.0.

### Final documentation and HACS metadata cleanup
- Fixed `hacs.json` so it is valid JSON instead of YAML.
- Updated configuration docs to describe first-run default seeding instead of removed `initial:` values.
- Added v1.2.0 Hidden PV Reveal, stability score, sun recovery, negative-price and final-restore behavior to the how-it-works documentation.
- Fixed troubleshooting references to removed or nonexistent entities.
- Removed the redundant `anyBelowFull` alias in the Node-RED flow.

### Cooldown debug sensor fix
- Added compact `cd` cooldown flag to the last-calculation JSON.
- Updated `binary_sensor.hpvc_cooldown_active` to read the compact cooldown flag so the dashboard Cooldown active indicator works again.

### Reveal deadband handling
- Hidden PV Reveal now applies the PV Adjustment Deadband to the total reveal request instead of each inverter share.
- Proportional inverter distribution is preserved for small reveal steps.
- Every proportional inverter change is applied once the total reveal exceeds the deadband.

### First-run defaults persistence fix
- Removed Node-RED flow-context default initialization.
- Added `input_boolean.hpvc_defaults_applied` as a Home Assistant first-run marker.
- Added a Home Assistant startup automation that applies recommended defaults only once on a new install.
- Helpers still have no `initial:` values, so user-edited values restore normally after Home Assistant restarts.

### Default seeding cleanup
- First-run default seeding now uses a 60 second cooldown to match the README recommended default.

### Adaptive Hidden PV Reveal foundation
- Added Adaptive Hidden PV Reveal for grid-following batteries.
- Reveal can restore hidden PV while PV is limited and an HBC battery is charging.
- Added mixed-inverter support so reveal works when one inverter is already closer to full than another.
- Added HBC battery-count handling using `input_number.house_battery_count`.
- Added safe fallback to one battery when `input_number.house_battery_count` is missing.
- Honored explicit `input_number.house_battery_count = 0`; fallback is used only when the helper is missing.
- Ignored missing HBC battery power sensors instead of treating them as idle `0 W` batteries.
- Added HBC max-charge awareness using `number.marstek_mX_max_charge_power`.
- Used the effective active charging-battery headroom instead of summing all battery headroom, matching HBC behavior where only one battery charges at a time.

### Automatic Adaptive Hidden PV Reveal
- Removed the old user-configurable Hidden PV Reveal step / Maximum Hidden PV Reveal Step helper before public release.
- Removed Recommended Values sensors and the Apply Recommended Values UI before public release.
- Removed the export-gap warning card, helper sensor, binary sensor, and auto-fix script before public release.
- Hidden PV Reveal is now fully automatic with no user-configured reveal power.
- Added an internal non-configurable **800 W safety cap**.
- Balanced reveal amount is calculated from:
  - effective active charging-battery headroom,
  - Target Export margin plus dynamic tolerance,
  - remaining hidden PV,
  - internal 800 W safety cap.
- Dynamic tolerance is calculated as:
  - `min(max(deadband × 2, active battery headroom × 0.25), 150 W)`.
- Export Start decides when PV limiting begins.
- Target Export decides the reveal recovery window.

### Reveal stability and solar response
- After each reveal, HPVC verifies that actual PV production increased enough.
- If raising inverter limits does not increase real PV production, HPVC pauses further reveal instead of repeatedly increasing limits when the sun cannot produce more.
- Added reveal accuracy history so one noisy sample does not immediately pause reveal.
  - good response raises the score,
  - weak response lowers it slightly,
  - poor response lowers it strongly,
  - reveal pauses below 40%.
- Added sun-recovery detection so reveal can resume when PV production rises again or export increases.

### Restore and import behavior
- Added final exact restore after Hidden PV Reveal completes.
- If one inverter is still slightly below its configured full limit, HPVC sends one final per-inverter restore command.
- Fixed import recalculation so high grid import no longer lowers PV limits when all inverters are already restored to full.
- Kept the normal PV Adjustment Deadband for regular control decisions.

### Diagnostics and dashboard
- Added improved Insights for reveal pause, resume and completion decisions.
- Pause Insights now include measured PV response, required PV response and stability score.
- Added compact diagnostics JSON fields for reveal diagnostics.
- Kept diagnostics JSON compact so it fits the Home Assistant input-text length limit.

### Runtime and packaging fixes
- Fixed Node-RED function scope issues so debug fields cannot crash the function node.

## v1.1.1

- Maintenance release based on v1.1.0.
- Updated `hpvc_config.yaml`, `hpvc_dashboard.yaml`, and `node-red/hpvc_flow.json` with the latest uploaded fixes.
- Keeps the v1.1.x helper names compatible while improving input-text based entity configuration.
- Changed recommended `initial:` values to all Home Assistant helpers.
- Minor dashboard fixes and cleanup.
- Added `input_text.hpvc_battery_strategy_entity` to the settings-changed watch list so editing the HBC strategy entity re-runs the flow immediately instead of waiting up to 15s.
- Added explicit validation for a negative inverter minimum power (`low_limit`); it is now reported as a configuration error instead of silently dropping the inverter from control.
- Aligned `hpvc_config.yaml` default values, the documentation's default-values table, and `hacs.json` domain list (removed unused `automation`, added `binary_sensor`) so shipped config, docs, and packaging metadata all agree.

## v1.1.0

> v1.0.7 was never released. All planned v1.0.7 work has been merged into this v1.1.0 release. Users can upgrade directly from v1.0.6 to v1.1.0.

### Timeline of changes

#### Debug and dashboard polish
- Expanded Insights from 10 to 20 items.
- Removed repetitive cooldown-finished entries from Insights so the history stays focused on useful events.
- Fixed cooldown insight time formatting to use 24-hour `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Added a 48-hour HBC strategy price graph using all-in prices in €/kWh.
- Added graph zone colors based on the configured Charge and Expensive price thresholds.
- Added a compact price-zone legend for Charge, Balanced and Expensive HBC strategy zones.
- Updated dashboard text for Hidden PV Reveal and v1.1.0 behavior.

#### Cooldown and PV recalculation behavior
- Allowed PV decisions immediately after cooldown expires instead of blocking the first post-cooldown evaluation.
- Fixed hidden-PV reveal so heavy grid import uses the normal fast import-recalculation path.
- Fixed mixed-inverter reveal behavior by only using Hidden PV Reveal when all configured inverters are below full output.
- Fixed PV recalculation to avoid losing recovery speed during significant import while PV is limited.

#### HBC strategy selection
- Improved HBC strategy notification wording during price hysteresis so entry and exit threshold messages are factually correct.
- Kept HBC strategy control optional; HPVC still works as a standalone PV controller when HBC is unavailable.

#### Hidden PV Reveal
- Added Hidden PV Reveal for grid-following batteries: when PV is limited and export is small, HPVC can gradually reveal extra PV so an HBC battery can see more available solar power.
- Added configurable Hidden PV Reveal step in the PV Export Control section.
- Set Hidden PV Reveal step range to 50–800 W with 100 W default.
- Improved the reveal allocator so small reveal steps are preserved across multi-inverter setups instead of being lost to per-inverter deadband.
- Added HBC battery-charging gate: reveal only runs when HBC strategy control is enabled and at least one active HBC battery is charging.
- Added HBC battery-count handling using `input_number.house_battery_count`.
- Added safe fallback to one battery when `input_number.house_battery_count` is missing.
- Honored an explicit `input_number.house_battery_count = 0`; fallback to one battery is used only when the helper is missing.
- Ignored missing HBC battery power sensors instead of treating them as idle `0 W` batteries.
- Added HBC Batteries max-charge awareness using `number.marstek_mX_max_charge_power`.
- Paused Hidden PV Reveal when active batteries are already at or near their configured maximum charge power.
- Added one-time pause and resume Insights for Hidden PV Reveal battery-charge availability.
- Added one-time completion Insight when Hidden PV Reveal fully restores PV output.
- Added clear reason text when Hidden PV Reveal is active but the calculated increase is below the PV deadband.
- Stopped repeat logging of Hidden PV Reveal pause messages; pause/resume/completion events now log only on state changes.

#### Startup and diagnostics
- Added a startup Insight when Home Assistant inputs finish restoring and HPVC resumes control.
- Added compact diagnostics JSON fields for battery power, battery charging state, charge headroom and max-charge state.
- Added compact `at_max_chg` diagnostics JSON field for max-charge reveal diagnostics.
- Fixed Hidden PV Reveal scope so startup or waiting states cannot throw `revealHiddenPv is not defined`.

#### Internal cleanup
- Removed unused battery detail variables from the Node-RED flow.
- Removed unused active battery summary string building.
- Cleaned and reorganized release documentation so all unreleased v1.0.7 work is documented under v1.1.0.
