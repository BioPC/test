# Home PV Control

Home PV Control (HPVC) dynamically controls, limits and restores PV inverter output in Home Assistant through Node-RED. It is designed for dynamic electricity contracts and can run as a standalone PV controller or integrate with Home Battery Control (HBC).

- Reduce unwanted or uneconomic PV export.
- Preserve useful PV for household consumption.
- Restore inverter output automatically when conditions improve.
- Coordinate available PV with optional HBC battery charging.
- Protect against negative all-in prices with minimum-PV control and optional HBC grid charging.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HPVC requires at least one configured inverter control path: either a writable Home Assistant `number` entity or a stable Home Assistant action/service adapter. Limits can use Watts or Percent. HPVC controls through Home Assistant integrations; it does not communicate with inverter hardware directly.

See [Inverter compatibility](docs/05-inverter-compatibility.md) and [Configuration](docs/02-configuration.md) for the four compatibility statuses, current brand/integration matrix and configuration.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant Core **2025.12 or newer**. HACS/native installation does not require Home Assistant package configuration; package support is needed only for the manual installation path.
- Node-RED with `node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket` **0.80.3 or newer**.
- One or more PV inverters with either a writable `number.*` active-power limit or a stable Home Assistant action/service that can apply an active-power limit.
- A valid grid-power sensor, market/export-price sensor, all-in-price sensor and PV-power sensor.
- ApexCharts Card for the supplied dashboard graphs.
- Home Battery Control only for optional HBC execution tracking and Charge Priority.

## Quick install

HPVC v1.5.2 supports both **HACS** and the existing **manual installation** method. Manual installation remains fully supported.

### Option 1 — HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=BioPC&repository=test&category=integration)

1. Open the button above and install **Home PV Control** as a HACS custom integration.
2. Restart Home Assistant so the new custom integration becomes available.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Home PV Control** and add it.
4. HPVC creates its required configuration/diagnostic entities natively and registers **Home PV Control** in the Home Assistant sidebar. **No `configuration.yaml` edit and no `/config/packages` setup are required.**
5. Import the bundled HACS `hpvc_flow.json` into Node-RED and deploy it. This remains deliberately semi-automatic: HPVC never silently replaces a user's Node-RED flow.
6. Configure HPVC from the sidebar **Settings** tab.

On later HACS updates, HACS updates the custom integration plus its bundled dashboard and Node-RED flow. Restart Home Assistant after the HACS update. The HPVC integration compares its version with the version published by the running Node-RED flow and exposes **Update required** when the flow still needs to be imported/deployed. HACS mode does not create or update `hpvc_config.yaml`.

### Option 2 — Manual installation

The traditional package + Node-RED + YAML-dashboard workflow is unchanged:

1. Enable Home Assistant packages with `packages: !include_dir_named packages`.
2. Copy [`home assistant/hpvc_config.yaml`](home%20assistant/hpvc_config.yaml) to `/config/packages/hpvc_config.yaml`.
3. Restart Home Assistant or reload the supported YAML configuration.
4. Import [`node-red/hpvc_flow.json`](node-red/hpvc_flow.json) into Node-RED and deploy it.
5. Add [`home assistant/hpvc_dashboard.yaml`](home%20assistant/hpvc_dashboard.yaml) as a YAML dashboard or view.
6. Configure the required sensors and inverter control paths from **Settings**.

See the full [installation guide](docs/01-installation.md) for dependencies, update behavior and first-run verification.

## How HPVC works

HPVC evaluates:

- every **10 seconds**;
- immediately after deploy/startup;
- when relevant HPVC settings change.

Normal control follows a simple priority order:

1. Validate required inputs and configured inverter limits.
2. Apply negative-price protection when the all-in price is `<= 0`.
3. Handle Night Restore when PV production has effectively ended.
4. Coordinate available PV with HBC Charge Priority when HBC is enabled and eligible.
5. Limit export when price and grid conditions require it.
6. Restore PV when import or price recovery makes more output appropriate.
7. Respect cooldown and deadband so unnecessary writes are avoided.

## Shipped defaults

These are starting points, not universal recommendations. Review them for your inverter, sensor definitions, electricity contract and local rules.

| Setting | Shipped default |
|---|---:|
| HBC integration / Charge Priority | Off |
| Force charge at negative price | On by default; effective only while HBC control is enabled |
| PV limiting price | `0.00 €/kWh` |
| Price hysteresis | `0.02 €/kWh` |
| Export start | `-150 W` |
| Target export | `0 W` |
| Import restore | `150 W` |
| Min PV for control | `100 W` |
| Night restore PV threshold | `10 W` |
| Cooldown | `30 s` |
| Deadband | `25 W` |


> **PV limiting price guidance:** use €0.00/kWh with a net export-price sensor. For a raw market-price sensor, account for fees, compensation and local rules.

See [Settings](docs/02-configuration.md#marketexport-price-sensor) for sensor guidance and examples.

## HBC permissions

**Enable HBC** is the master permission for HPVC to control charging in HBC.

The separate **Force charge at negative price** option only applies while HBC control is enabled.

If HBC permission is removed during an already-active override, HPVC permits only the required restore sequence and then stops HBC writes.

### HBC Charge Priority

Charge Priority uses HBC execution state, measured battery power and verified battery headroom rather than assuming a selected strategy means charging is active.

- States: **Off, Requested, Waiting, Active**.
- Supports HBC battery order and RS485 eligibility for **1–6 batteries**.
- Multi-battery headroom and taper learning prevent one tapering/full battery from unnecessarily reducing available headroom from another battery.
- A short HBC response window allows HBC to absorb newly released PV before HPVC applies opposite export corrections.
- If confirmed battery charging drops into Waiting, a bounded transition-settle window lets the independent battery controller change state before HPVC reacts to the full transient grid error.
- Small PV corrections remain immediate; large normal corrections and Charge Priority releases are plant-size-relative and staged, with extra damping on the first large reversal.
- Persistent unabsorbed export still falls back to normal PV limiting.

## Safety and recovery

- Required sensors, inverter entities, helper ranges, duplicate entities and threshold relationships are validated before writes.
- Any unavailable configured inverter pauses the complete inverter group.
- Night Restore tolerates expected overnight PV/inverter-limit disappearance but never treats `unknown`/`unavailable` PV as measured zero.
- Battery freshness uses multiple telemetry signals and configured charging/discharging cutoffs.
- Invalid live cutoff values are faults rather than silently replaced defaults.
- HBC-dependent Charge Priority suspends on uncertain battery telemetry while normal PV control can continue where safe.
- Negative-price override state is persisted and restored safely across restart/deploy.
- Recovery paths require confirmed healthy data before dependent control resumes.

## Accuracy, Insights and reports

### Daily Control Accuracy

Daily Control Accuracy measures how closely grid power follows the requested target and exposes four headline loss factors:

- **Control response**
- **House load changes**
- **PV availability**
- **Other**

The factor values represent estimated percentage contributions to the headline accuracy loss and reconcile to `100 − Daily Control Accuracy`.

HPVC uses a short physical-event reconciliation window so delayed PV, battery and inverter-limit telemetry can still be associated with the grid event that caused the loss without delaying control. Detailed raw attribution, continuity and engineering metrics remain available in the support report. For Action/service inverters, this physical attribution requires a real numeric readback entity; command-cache-only adapters still participate in control and headline accuracy, but their cached command is not treated as physical inverter-limit evidence.

### Today’s Insights and Power Control

- Insights focus on meaningful transitions, warnings, faults and recoveries.
- HBC-only safety pauses remain distinguishable from full HPVC control blocks.
- Power Control history records current-day control activity and retains enough rows for a full day at the 10-second cadence.

### Support reports

On-demand HTML/TXT reports include:

- current HPVC decision and control mode;
- inverter state and calculated targets;
- inverter adapter, control-method and readback diagnostics;
- required sensor health;
- HBC strategy/execution and Charge Priority state;
- battery eligibility, headroom and taper diagnostics;
- negative-price override state;
- Daily Control Accuracy and attribution diagnostics;
- Today’s Insights and Power Control history.

Reports are generated from one shared fresh model and published atomically. Non-structural parity warnings no longer block **View report**; structural/shared-model failures still do.

## Architecture and persistence

    PRICE[Market / all-in price]
    GRID[Grid power]
    PV[PV power]
    HBC[Optional HBC]

    PRICE --> HPVC
    GRID --> HPVC
    PV --> HPVC
    HBC --> HPVC
    BAT --> HPVC
    HPVC --> LIMITS
```

The Node-RED flow is organized into four functional tabs. Current-day Insights, Power Control, Daily Control Accuracy and negative-price override state share the private `hpvc-data/runtime-history.json` journal.

Journal writes are serialized and guarded against stale completions. Runtime waits for current-day restoration before dependent actions continue, which avoids startup/redeploy races.

## Upgrading

When upgrading, keep the Home Assistant package, Node-RED flow and dashboard on the same release version.

1. Back up the current package, dashboard, Node-RED flow and `hpvc-data` journal.
2. Replace the Home Assistant package.
3. Replace the complete Node-RED flow.
4. Replace or merge the dashboard.
5. Restart Home Assistant and deploy Node-RED.
6. Verify configured sensors and inverter limits.
7. Review **Force charge at negative price**. It is seeded **On** once on fresh installs and upgrades. After that, a manual Off choice survives normal Home Assistant restarts and package/automation reloads. **Restore defaults** turns it On again.
8. Generate a support report to confirm the installation is healthy.

See the [v1.5.2 release notes](releases/v1.5.2/release.md) for the full release summary.
