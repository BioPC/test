## Requirements

- Home Assistant
- Node-RED
- PV inverter(s) with writable power limit entities
- HBC is optional and only required for battery strategy control

⚠️ Home PV Control is designed for PV inverters that support external power limit control (curtailment). PV curtailment features require at least one writable inverter power limit entity.


## Home PV Control (HPVC)

**Home PV Control** is a standalone photovoltaic export-control add-on for Home Assistant and Node-RED. It works independently or together with **Home Battery Control (HBC)**.

- 🌐 Documentation for HBC: https://docs.homebatterycontrol.com/

Home PV Control manages PV inverter power limits while HBC remains responsible for battery charging, discharging and strategy selection.

> Home PV Control does **not** modify Home Battery Control files. It runs next to HBC.

## Designed for Dynamic Energy Contracts

Home PV Control is primarily designed for households with dynamic electricity tariffs.
Many of its advanced optimization features are specifically intended for dynamic pricing environments.

## What it does

Home PV Control dynamically controls writable PV inverter limit entities.

It is designed for:

- dynamic energy prices
- negative price hours
- avoiding export when export is not wanted
- keeping useful PV for house load
- smoothly increasing PV again when the house starts importing
- systems with one inverter or many inverters

```

Home PV Control may optionally select the HBC strategy, but HBC still performs the battery control.

## Quick install

1. Copy `home assistant/pv_ems_config.yaml` to:

   ```text
   /config/packages/pv_ems_config.yaml
   ```

2. Quick Reload or Restart Home Assistant.

3. Import `node-red/pv_ems_flow.json` into Node-RED and deploy.

4. Add/import `home assistant/pv_ems_dashboard.yaml` as a separate dashboard.

5. Configure core entities:
   - grid power sensor
   - market/export price sensor
   - all-in import price sensor
   - PV total power sensor
   - inverter limits

6. Enable Home PV Control.

See [Installation](docs/01-installation.md).

The EMS calculates total target PV power and splits it proportionally by `full_power`.

Each inverter is clamped to its own `minimum_power`.

## Default recommended values

| Setting | Recommended |
|---|---:|
| PV Limiting Price | `0.00 €/kWh` |
| Start Limiting Export | `-200 W` |
| Target Export | `-25 W` |
| Import Recalculation | `200 W` |
| Minimum PV Power | `100 W` |
| Night Restore | `10 W` |
| Hidden PV Reveal Step | `100 W` |
| Minimum PV Change | `1 min` |
| Deadband | `25 W` |

## Trigger design

Home PV Control evaluates on:

- Every 15 seconds: PV limit, restore, negative-price mode and HBC strategy.
- On deploy/startup: one immediate evaluation.
- When Home PV Control settings change: one immediate evaluation.

The package does not use hardcoded grid/PV sensor triggers, so it stays generic for every installation.

## HACS note

This repository is structured to be easy to use with Home Assistant and Node-RED.  
It is **not a normal Python Home Assistant integration**. HACS support would require using this as a custom repository for documentation/files, not as a standard integration install.

See [HACS notes](docs/wiki/HACS.md).
